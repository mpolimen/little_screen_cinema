    {% fa_inline check-circle fas %} &nbsp; No spoilers ahead! The following post is intended for those who have or have not seen <i>ERASED</i> to get a better understanding of why I consider it the perfect introduction to anime for newcomers and skeptics. HEADS UP, there will be a small spoiler-filled section at the end; though, there will be a very clear warning prior, so please read ahead with no fear.</p></span>

I can still recall the cringe that shivered through my body to watch some of the members of my high school's anime club act. It caused me to associate the entire medium (yes, anime is not a genre but a medium) with *cringe*; watching anime would threaten my social standing and my self perception of being *cool*. â‰ˆ75 anime series watched, and I'd say I'm no closer to being similar to those anime club members than I was prior.

**Watching anime isn't cringe. Making anime your personality is.**

With that disclaimer out of the way, hopefully I have the attention of any skeptics reading now. The landscape of anime is a treasure trove of stories that typically weaponize animation to accomplish artistic feats unique to the medium. A **gateway anime** is an anime that is suitable for those unfamiliar with anime in order to provide them with a general picture of what anime can offer, while also leaning only lightly on common tropes of the medium.

[*ERASED*](https://myanimelist.net/anime/31043/Boku_dake_ga_Inai_Machi) is a 2016 show that, at the time of its airing, had the anime community's full attention. It is only 12 "half hour" episodes, and there is an option to watch it entirely in English, known as an English dub; I personally watched it in English and found it was a nicely done dub, though watching with the original Japanese voice acting with English subtitles is also a great option here. Well, there's only one place to start this essay...

### Opening Scene - Revival

<div style="max-width:750px; margin: auto;">

</div>

Let's take a look at *ERASED*'s first scene. Right here, the show needs to earn the viewer's attention, especially for any skeptics. One of the most tried and true ways to accomplish this: the **mystery box**; utilizing a high concept in fiction founded on secrets underpinning the mechanics of the story's universe. We open the show immediately with such a mystery: "what is revival; how does it work; why is it happening?" According to J.J. Abrams, "What I love about this box is I find myself drawn to infinite possibility, that sense of potential. And I realize that mystery is a catalyst for imagination." In essence, the mystery of revival captures our attention because it holds potential for the story, and it engages our imagination to speculate on how that potential can come to fruition, helping us to form a connection with the story from the get-go.

The pilot episode also trickles in more mysteries, potentially interconnected, throughout, but to remain spoiler-free, I won't dissect them here. Just know the show builds on revival enough to prompt further speculation, yet keeping it elusive so viewers are hooked to watch the next episode.

### Setting - Japan

<div style="max-width:750px; margin: auto;">
    <img src="pilot.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; width: auto\9;">
</div>

A question you may have been wondering, was *ERASED* the anime that got *me* into watching more anime? No, it was when I rewatched [*Avatar: The Last Airbender*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/); yes, I'm considering it eligible to be a gateway anime contender. While I recommend *Avatar* with my whole heart, and I can see it serving as an easy alternative gateway anime, I think there's a specific deficiency it has in informing the viewer how they might like other anime. Specifically, I think that understanding more of Japan and its culture will help viewers engage more thoughtfully with works from the country. Despite *Avatar* wearing many Eastern inspirations on its sleeve, I believe it in insufficient at accomplishing this prerequisite; not to mention how hard it is to recommend someone a 60+ episode show: +1 to *ERASED* for being short and sweet!

Now, *ERASED* strikes a good balance of introducing viewers to modern day Japan, where they can pinpoint day-to-day differences between it and western culture, yet the show doesn't rely on an understanding of the Japanese way of life to build drama upon, providing a low stakes environment for the viewer to familiarize themself with the country. Again, this is in service of preparing the viewer to venture into anime beyond *ERASED*, which some may require more knowledge of the culture. Now, if this sounds strange, just think about how bizarre [*Breaking Bad*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/) would seem to someone who has no notion of how the American healthcare system operates or the state of drug use in the country. Context is certainly a benefit when starting a new story.

### Aesthetics

</div>

Let's kick it off real quick with how dope the intro sequence is. The use of the song for the first time during the pilot episode's credits to swell our excitement for what's to come next in the story. When we see the full sequence with accompanying visuals, we're treated to a visual delight; after you finish the series, totally check out this [video essay](https://youtu.be/XjzW81ucoaM?si=e7NmXm1NTO9MXvF7) dissecting just how good it is.

The visual choices in this show are astounding from aspect ratio, editing, creative use of color, and overall direction. This feels **cinematic**, helping to encase you in its world, while avoiding some less palatable visual tropes found in some anime like exaggerated reactions. There is nothing about this show that should make even an anime skeptic feel slightly embarrassed about, allowing them to focus on the content rather than overcoming the cringe.

I mention the aesthetics because I believe they contribute wholly to the core of the show: its heart. Yes, introducing a mystery can suck us in to a story, but there needs to be more to allow us to fall in love. We are met with so many characters who are insecure, including our protagonist. At the heart of the show is watching our characters work past insecurity to form an authentic connection so that we don't ever see "A Town Where Only I Am Missing".

### The Ending

<div style="max-width:750px; margin: auto;">

</div>

Many of you reading that *have* completed *ERASED* are probably wondering what is wrong with me; how could I recommend something that will disappoint them in the end? Surely, I must know that the ending of the series is downright awful.

Well, to be honest, as I've said before: **the heart is the core of the show, not the mystery**. Though the mystery of the killer isn't satisfying, the mystery wasn't what brought me the most joy through my time with the show. It was always about our cast of characters forming bonds that will help them to become more confident, secure people.

With that being said, I won't claim that it's incorrect to be furious at the ending. I actually think that the rage a first time watcher can feel about it furthers my point about how good this show is as a starting point. For something to cause so much anger, means that, at some point, they were truly invested; a clear demonstration that they absolutely fell in love with an anime. This may cause them to consult friends or online forums about the ending, driving discussion and community engagement, only serving to expose them to the larger anime discourse.

Now knowing that they have the capacity to love anime, having access to a devoted community of fans online or otherwise, and being aware that they haven't seen even close to the best that the world of anime has to offer. Well, I think the controversial ending is more of a feature than a bug when used in the context of *ERASED* being a gateway anime.
