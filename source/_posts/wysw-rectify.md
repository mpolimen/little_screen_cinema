*Rectify* was Sundance TV's first original series, and it flew under audiences' radar for its entire run; though, the few who have seen it mostly regard it as one of the best written television shows of all time. Here's why I'm one of those viewers.

### Daniel's Guilt

> Over the past two decades, I have developed a strict routine I have followed religiously, you might say. A way of living and thinking, or not thinking as was often the point... Now this way of being didn't encourage the contemplation that a day like today could ever occur... I had convinced myself that kind of optimism served no useful purpose in the world where I existed.

These are, main focal point, Daniel Holden's first thoughts given to the press upon his release from death row in episode one. He spent half of his life after being convicted at the age of 18 for the rape and murder of his girlfriend.

Though his death sentence leaned on his confession to the crimes, new DNA evidence had completely disputed the rape charge and put into question whether the murder was his doing either. So, was it? We don't know and neither does Daniel. He doesn't remember the night clearly due to drug use; he was found the next morning holding the dead victim's hand and putting flowers in her hair. To muddy the picture even more, it is hinted that foul play caused his confession, as he was questioned for 11 hours with only the last hour being recorded.

The guilt portrayed by Daniel gives a unique character study on identity. Making him question whether he really knows himself. All the while, so many around him confidently profess his innocence or guilt as if they witnessed the events leading to Hannah's demise themselves. His family who puts faith in his innocence are grateful to have Daniel home, but now, they must deal with blowback from townsfolk: vandalism, rude remarks, etc.. Does Daniel think his freedom is worth the trouble it's causing his family, when he can't even be sure of his own innocence?

### Solitary Confinement

> When you are alone with yourself all the time, with no one but yourself, you begin to go deeper and deeper into yourself until... you lose yourself. It's a perverse contradiction. It's like your ego begins to disintegrate until you... have no ego. Not in the sense that you... you become humble or... or gain some kind of perspective, but that you literally lose your sense of self. And I'm not sure anyone, unless they have gone through it, can... can truly understand how... profound that loss is. It's like the psychic glue that binds your whole notion of existence is gone, and you become unglued. I think, therefore I am. I think too much, therefore I am not. I am not, therefore I am nothing. I am nothing, therefore I am dead. And if I am dead, then why am I still so goddamn lonely?



According to French philosopher Blaise Pascal, "All of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone." Daniel crafts a framework for himself in order to mentally survive his solitary confinement through reading and meditation. Mindfulness was important to avoid dwelling on his uncertain past, regarding Hannah's death, and his certain future, lethal injection.

> "Most of what I draw on from inside my head are things I've read about. My real life experiences are actually rather narrow. I don't think about the seasons. Not for the longest time, anyway... The place where I was had no windows... So I never knew if it was raining or heard the loudest thunder. No, it's not as bad as it sounds; because I didn't sense things in the normal way, I didn't miss them. If I couldn't sense them, they weren't real to me."

During the show, we spend some scenes revisiting Daniel's time in solitary confinement since it is such a substantial and formative period for who he is upon release. Importantly, we meet his neighbor Kerwin who Daniel developed a relationship with speaking through the vents joining their cells. Kerwin serves as the only reprieve from the monotony that Daniel's life would otherwise consist of from his survival framework. Kerwin's time with Daniel convinces him of Daniel's innocence (another person who knows Daniel more confidently than himself), but he can't convince Daniel to hold out hope: "Sometimes it seems you don't wanna get out. You the most reluctant innocent man I ever seen".

Contrastingly, we are also exposed to some of the more deplorable human beings that Daniel shares the row with. For some of the more brutal tales from inside, the show takes us away from the horror through Daniel's retelling of traumatic experiences he endured. This experience gives Daniel a unique appreciation of the simple joys of outside life. 

### Magic in the Mundane

After moving into his new bedroom, Daniel spends entire days fascinated, exploring every detail. It's possible you experienced a similar fixation if you spent a lot of time in the same room during pandemic quarantine, where every detail of something can't be brushed over. Although you might think someone who has been trapped away for so many years might have a bucket list of places to visit upon release, Daniel is simply enchanted by this new location after so long. Which makes sense: Daniel fell asleep on the way home from his prison from exhaustion of witnessing the new sites.

Ever rediscover a favorite song from your childhood? Imagine that feeling amplified for Daniel after 18 years of no music when he stumbles upon his Walkman in the attic. Not just music, either. Daniel goes through a small spurt of regression for all of his things. He left his home at the age of 18. He returns to find his favorite clothes, video games, and songs waiting for him, unchanged. How would he grow out of these things when there was nothing to replace them inside?

*Rectify* makes a point that besides magnifying the magic in the mundanity, his solitary confinement also intensifies the pain:

> Just not used to contemplating all the variables one might encounter. I mean there were variables inside, but wasn't like out here... Y'know if you don't have the years of experiences, if there isn't the repetition of everyday living to make things mundane, because mundane is calming and soothing, mundane isn't out of the ordinary. And when everything is out of the ordinary, it can be too much sometimes.

### Perspective

This whole post has focused pretty heavily on Daniel, but *Rectify* has excellent character work running deep through its ensemble. One character may even challenge Daniel for depth, in my eyes. Be careful not to dislike characters, just because they don't get the attention that Daniel receives to flesh them out because, when *Rectify* focuses on a character, you'll understand why these are all just people. Remember, if Daniel was someone you just saw on the news, rather than a character with the focus this series gives him, maybe you'd brush him off as some murder, not worthy of your sympathy.

A lot of care went into the details of these characters' lives to hone in on their individual perspectives. Daniel is diagnosed with Near-work Myopia â€” blurred distance vision caused by overuse of the eyes' focusing mechanism. After his long stay in a cramped environment, his eyes were unable to refocus to see clearly in the distance.

There is this really fun series of videos on YouTube, [Gaming for a Non-Gamer](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLordXx8iNEyStcX_WzqM0JCpiJYgqhinc) where someone with a passion for gaming gets his wife to try out multiple games, as a non-gamer. Through her eyes, we see that the common design language of video games, like using the mouse to look around in a 3D environment, are not easily understood if you haven't been countlessly exposed to the same patterns time and again from other games. I love this video series and think it parallels the idea of perspective in *Rectify*. It really takes sitting down and viewing something through another person's eyes to see how wildly different things from their perspective can seem.
