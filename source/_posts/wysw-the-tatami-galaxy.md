</div>


<p>Meet <b>Watashi</b>, the protagonist of <i><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/7785/Yojouhan_Shinwa_Taikei?q=the%20tatami&cat=anime">The Tatami Galaxy</a></i>: after missing his opportunity in high school, he starts college with the goal of choosing the right club to join that will give him the perfect college experience, the <b>Rose-Colored Campus Life</b>. The show takes him on a journey into what each decision offers him, always leaving him with regrets.</p>

New chapters of life, like starting college, promise fulfillment of our dreams. Have you ever caught yourself thinking, "Once I'm out of school, I can start to *really* pursue that hobby" or "After I get that great job, I'll finally be able to relax a little and enjoy life"? However, these notions merely delay actions that can be taken in the present to pursue those dreams and attain happiness *now*.

My goal with this article is to explain why going through these possible lives of Watashi's can leave a lasting impression on how you live your own life, while explaining how the pieces of this show come together to convey its message so artistically. Now that we're on the same page, let's begin with...

### The Presentation

<div style="max-width:750px; margin: auto;">

</div>
<p>Right off the bat, it's hard to ignore <i>Tatami's</i> distinct look. Whether you've seen a lot of anime or not, the aesthetic here is not typical by any stretch. Each scene greatly benefits from applied color filters as they inform the mood.</p>

The flat yet springy character designs allow for the show's direction to flow in a creative way emulating a fever dream, at times. The everchanging color palette also contributes to that feeling, yet it also aids in the show's themes: all of these possible lives are filled with many colors.

Quick note on the [soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWC_NsJGfO4&t=143s), each main character is given an instrumental theme that captures the essence of their portrayal in the story (think *Peter and the Wolf*, where the duck is identified by the oboe). Also, personally, it's one of the only music choices in my rotation if I'm listening to something while I work.

### Watashi

</div>

Our protagonist, Watashi, is another unique aspect of the show. In Japanese, Watashi translates, roughly, to "myself". So, we aren't following some separate character but, in fact, a representation of us, the viewer. Every time you can point out a bias or a shortcoming of Watashi, you should look inward to see where in your own life could you have better addressed a situation in a similar way.

Since *we* are the protagonist, there is a first person perspective given where we get Watashi's rapid-fire thoughts narrated to us. Actually the opening scene of the show is notorious for how fast-paced the narration (and therefore, the subtitles since you'll need the English subtitles to check this out) are. The ultra-fast dialogue only comes from Watashi's internal thoughts, truly mimicking our own overthinking.

Although it could be frustrating, I think the experience of missing words and sentences as subtitles race by creates authenticity in the presentation, crafting a reflection of our own thought patterns. You'll almost certainly not read every word in the subtitles on the first viewing due to sheer speed alone, but I guarantee that you won't miss the important themes with all of the...

### Repetition

<div style="max-width:750px; margin: auto;">
    <img src="tatami_clock_tower.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; width: auto\9;">
</div>


With *Tatami's* premise of showing different versions of a life based on changing one decision, the show could go in one of two directions:

1. <p>Demonstrate how wildly different each life would be</p>

2. <p>Highlight how things are always the same, in some way</p>

It goes for route #2 and hammers in the parallels with repetition. Specifically, key aspects of Watashi's life, irrespective of what decision he makes, always pop up: talking to a fortune teller and getting charged for a fortune that goes over his head, meeting Ozu who he blames for wasting his "perfectly lovely college life", and being around Akashi as she gets frightened by a moth.

Every path leads him to the same conclusion:

> I can't shake the regret. If I had chosen a different club, my years would have surely turned out differently.

Making a decision can be HARD. Through its use of repetition, *The Tatami Galaxy* offers us comfort in the idea that whatever decision we make, our life will still brim with a mix of colors and some experiences and people will be a part of our life regardless, even if the details are a little different; conversely, it also reminds us that no decision will ever lead us to a rose-colored life of perfection.

### Personal Impact

One of my favorite quotes comes from [this essay](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20200518-the-animation-that-showed-me-the-meaning-of-life) on the show:

> Making success a cornerstone of your happiness is, in fact, to put it forever out of your reach, while distancing yourself from the important things already immediately around you.

All my life, I've worked hard in my endeavors. Though I've enjoyed school, sports, and anything else that required my effort, there was always this promise of fulfillment at the end of the tunnel as a reward for a job well done. Always focusing your present on success or the promise of a better future will ensure that the future you want will never come. We need to take time to enjoy the present; although the present isn't everything, there are some things you can only do in this moment.

This essay started with phrases like this one that I've caught myself thinking, "once I finish my degree, I'll finally be able to read in my free time and relax" because I fell in love with story-telling a couple years ago and *wanted* to read, but a lifetime of poor reading assignments from school caused an aversion when it came to reading for leisure.

*The Tatami Galaxy* encouraged me to start reading this past summer. While there have been struggles, I've experienced some great stories ([a new favorite](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31373633-and-every-morning-the-way-home-gets-longer-and-longer?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=wVZYZIWBHE&rank=1)), and I'm on the path to finding many more. Maybe one day, I'll find one that will impact my life as much as *The Tatami Galaxy* has.

### Grab This Opportunity

<p>To heed the words from <i>Tatami's</i> fortune teller:</p>

So grab this opportunity to watch *The Tatami Galaxy*! Or, "you will walk this life as now, ever unchanging"... that'll be 1,000 yen.
