> **Zugzwang** - a situation in which the obligation to make a move in one's turn is a serious, often decisive, disadvantage.

2023, for me, has been a year grappling with zugzwang — in romance, purpose, and career. Circumstances were destined to worsen, irrespective of the path I chose to follow when faced with a crossroads. Just as I came to terms with the shattering of my heart from a significant person in my life, I was faced with newfound uncertainty of my post-college career and life. When I look back on my early 2021 watch of [*Lodge 49*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6128254/), “zugzwang” is the motif that emitted a light for me to navigate back to shore during this year’s turbulent waters.

In the show, our characters are in constant drudgery, with only the small respite of The Lodge: a social community to share in the suffering of their lives, dampening its magnitude. A key aspect of the communal resignation to retaliate against this reality is the fact that most of these downtrodden workers made the “smart” career decision: getting an engineering degree and working for Orbis, an aircraft manufacturer destined for continued economic significance in the booming Long Beach area. Yet, just as Ernie and Dud reflect on [here](https://youtu.be/dsqmpxJTShw?si=Rw0XGPfDzfxZP2LD), it really doesn’t matter if you make the “smart” choice or the “stupid” choice, we’re gonna lose anyway! The key to this scene is accepting the beauty of the futility, embracing zugzwang.

To touch on my personal dilemma, I’m also tasked with accepting my offer with an Orbis equivalent (the same company I interned with as I wrote [Free Men Along the Rails](https://mpolimen.github.io/little_screen_cinema/2022/06/10/three-men-along-the-rails/), which I was coincidentally motivated to write after watching my favorite episode of *Lodge 49*, “Circles”, a candidate for my favorite episode of television!); taking the offer feels like a safe passage to gain entry into a successful career of software engineering. Though it comes at the cost of my physical presence in an area that holds so many people I care for and opportunities for me to jumpstart a side career in teaching, fulfilling a major purpose of mine. With the state of the job market, finding an entry level role to replace this admittedly great career option has been a fruitless mission; though, accepting the offer comes at the cost of valuable aspects of my life that I prioritize over my career.

At the time of writing this, I have no idea what my life will look like in a month: where I’ll be living, what my day-to-day will consist of, how drastically my relationships will change, and what new futile decisions I’ll be faced with. Though I know from the show, that there is magic around every corner, even in the bleakest situations. I know my own happiness set point is quite high, and I will eventually settle back to a high level of joy, even if my short term is rocky. For me, there’s no clear delineation between the “smart” choice and the “stupid” choice, but honestly, I don’t have much of a choice when I’m in great need of money to live, making it hard to turn down a reprieve from financial anxiety by accepting the job offer; though, in my heart, I’m confident that making the decision to be around those I care about (like Ernie and Dud do for Blaise) just feels right.
