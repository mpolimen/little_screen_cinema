Three weeks ago, I both graduated college and started my summer internship; achieving this internship came from years of professional development and skill building to reach a personal goal for my career. When in a college environment (especially in STEM), it's sometimes hard not to get wrapped up in the future, eager to make your degree "worth it" with the job of your dreams.

### Three Men

</div>

Like myself in my new role, *Three Men Along the Rails* depicts three men all working their first job. The job descriptions are as follows:

- <p><b>Man 1</b>: Pulls grass and polishes rails; "tracks weren't being used but they might one day."</p>

- <p><b>Man 2</b>: Removes the rails; "tracks weren't being used."</p>

- <p><b>Man 3</b>: Replaces the rails; "might start using some old tracks again."</p>

Seemingly all working for the same employer, none of these men are given the scope and vision for their labor. There is almost a beauty in how the polish work done by the first man enables the second man to easily tear the rails up and how those freshly removed railings become the materials to create something new by the third man; however, without the knowledge of the grander picture, these three men lose the possibility to find purpose in their work as their true accomplishments are abstracted from them. Each man labors solely for the wages to send back to wives, children, sick parents, and brothers that they never get to visit, given the nature of their task. These men continue to work this horrid job simply because "Nobody ever told me to stop", and since they never stop the work, they lose the possibility to find purpose in their life outside of it.

Though these three men follow along a path, the literal train tracks, they are aimless without a purpose. The question each man asks Kino as she departs from their conversation is bathed in the irony of their pitiful situation:

> Traveler, where are you headed to?

### Stress is Wealth

Kino shares a peculiar story with the first man on the train tracks about a country where advancements in machine technology eliminated the need for human labor to operate society (anyone else getting major WALL-E vibes?). Despite human labor offering no tangible value to society, everyone still showed up for work to complete pointless tasks that the machines already perform more efficiently. Why? One citizen puts it, "We need something in life to keep us from being lazy, and that's work!" Yet, it's not so simple, as citizens performing these pointless tasks work for the stress as a currency, leading to stress-induced ulcers and suicides.

Now, this episode paints a particular portrait of employment that is certainly not congruent with everyone's experience; though, many can probably connect to the despair that accompanies a pointless job that doesn't align with their idea of fulfillment. So, what can we take from this episode? That there's no hope in finding meaning in our employment, and we should just travel the world like Kino? Well, that's not completely off...

### The Great Resignation

</div>

For those unfamiliar, **The Great Resignation**, as it's been dubbed, is a recent movement to rethink where, how, and why we work. As the name implies, this rethinking has called a lot of workers to resign and possibly find work that accommodates their lifestyle, which has seemingly caused improvements to work-life balance for many employees. I think *this* is the answer. If you want to travel like Kino, live the life of a digital nomad and you can both work and travel. But to take this approach, you need to find your purpose, and then, you need to take action to pursue it.

*A Land of Decision by Majority* may seem a disjointed story addition in this episode, but I think it layers on the idea that you need to be your own advocate. I like to imagine that this is the home country of the three men Kino met along the tracks. These men are directionless, only following the life given to them in order to provide for their loved ones, entrusting that the system will all work out due to their dedication. If any of these men ever had the chance to visit home, there'd only be a graveyard there to greet them.

### Where am I headed to?

When I finally stepped into the working world to enjoy the fruits of my years of effort, thinking I was now on the train tracks to fulfillment, no longer in the forest where I may get lost, I had a small crisis. I never thought about what I want, my purpose, if you will. Work hasn't been enjoyable thus far; I got my first paycheck today, but I'm honestly not even that thrilled about it. I don't have a direction, so my employment, 40 hours of every week, is just something I do; I may find moments of enjoyment and times of stress, but I haven't yet figured out how it works into my personal framework for how I want to live. Until writing this post and reflecting on *Three Men Along the Rails*, I couldn't quite figure out why I wasn't enjoying the job I worked so damn hard to obtain.

I'm going to take some time, maybe even the entire summer, to figure out my purpose; I'll take actionable steps to fuse it with my internship to get a clearer idea of how to make my job work for me, once I graduate from my Masters. I don't know where I'm headed to, and I don't need to. The idea of introspection, in this case, is to orient yourself towards your values, not to have an ideal scenario planned out to achieve. In accordance with that statement, my advice to make them **free** men along the rails, "decide on your own path; don't just follow the one laid out before you".
