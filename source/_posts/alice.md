    {% fa_inline exclamation-circle fas %} &nbsp; Spoilers for the penultimate episode of <i>Mrs. America</i>, which essentially means spoilers for the entire show. This mini series is a great show, worthy of this episode analysis piece, so if you haven't seen it, I highly recommend experiencing the journey for yourself before reading any spoilers below.</p></span>

[*Mrs. America*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9244556/)'s penultimate episode *Houston* opens up in November 1977 with 3 states short of being in favor of the ratification of the [Equal Rights Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment) (hereafter referred to as ERA), guaranteeing a shift in American society where equal legal rights would be afforded irrespective of sex.

Our journey following the conservative women opposing its ratification comes to a head in this episode, where tensions are high. We follow Alice and Pamela through this episode as they look to serve their mission of convincing more of the country that the ERA would not be in the best interest of women, while also fantasizing about telling ERA supporter Gloria Steinem off...

> Oh. You think marriage is prostitution? Do I look a prostitute, you radical pinko man-hater? Commie spinster!

### Historical Context

> "... women are often weakened by the internalized demands of the male-dominated society itself, as well as by a plethora of material goods and comforts: the middle class woman has a great deal more to lose than her chains." - Linda Nochlin, *Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?*, 1971

To lay the historical context, I'll be relying heavily on Linda Nochlin's seminal essay *Why Have There Been No Great Women Artists?*, which essentially led to a revolution in feminist art history; this essay being published around half a decade prior to the events in *Houston*. This first observation from Nochlin denotes many of the foundations for the rejection of the ERA. Many of these middle class women have arguably good, comfortable lives; why should they risk losing the niceties of their lives? This is similar to the concept of [golden handcuffs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/goldenhandcuffs.asp), keeping employees *stuck* at a company because the financial incentive to stay is just too great, regardless of whether it is in their best interest holistically (ironically, this term was first coined in the 1970's).

> "The fault... lies not in our stars, our hormones, our menstrual cycles, or our empty internal spaces, but in our institutions and our education."

Most of Phyllis Schlafly's team of housewives in support of her anti-ratification effort had not been afforded a proper education, as for many women of the time, it wasn't even a consideration to have that expectation for oneself; contradictorily, Schlafly's education and intellectual prowess was weaponized to convince these women, who otherwise don't have the time or access to consider political issues, empowering them to have a voice, even if that voice is just an echo. We see this clearly as Alice rehearses *her* speech written entirely by Phyllis, who she sees as a "better version" of all the women Alice knows; *something* to aspire to; she makes Alice feel smarter.

> "To be able to do a great many things tolerably well, is of infinitely more value to a woman, than to be able to excel in any one. By the former, she may render herself as generally useful; by the latter, she may dazzle for an hour. By being appropriately and tolerably well skilled in everything, she may fall into any situation in life with dignity and ease—by devoting her time to excellence in one, she may remain incapable of every other."

The expectations for women are overwhelming. While, in a typical heterosexual partnership, the man can focus on excellence in his job to provide financial stability for the unit, all other functions necessarily fall to the woman. This is a suffocating reality, which is explored through Pamela in this episode. Additionally, being "generally useful" is hard to quantify for success, where as the men are afforded an easy metric of mathematical value through income; with this in mind, there's an extra barrier to escaping the societal male dominance in minds at large. As Nochlin beautifully recognizes "Nothing, I think, is more interesting, more poignant, and more difficult to seize, than the intersection of the self and history."

### Pamela

</div>

> I have been looking forward to this for months. I need a break. I have the kids tugging at me all the time, and Kevin needs to know where I am all the time. I can't think at home. I need to think... Maybe I won't go back. I'll just get pregnant again. I can't have another child. I can barely...

Pamela has lost all agency in her life through her husband's tyrannical reign over her freedoms: complete financial control, veto power for actions, and overwhelming dutiful expectations. The only reason Pamela and Alice got lost on the drive to the convention was because Pamela deceived her husband (finally!) resulting in no way for her to finance a flight. Alice reacts declaring that Pamela's husband has a **right** to know and object, clearly avoiding the reality of Pamela's suffocating existence.

It's no wonder that Pamela, in her cramped hotel room, had the "best sleep [she's] had in six years". The freedom this dutiful "vacation" offers Pamela rejuvenates her, shining light that her "nice, comfortable" home life resembles anything but that. This cramped hotel room also gives our Pamela a chance to see compare how Phyllis treats them exactly the same as a husband would—a utility to be orchestrated; whereas, Gloria Steinem is witnessed, firsthand in the hotel room, to take input and confirmation from her fellow woman before putting a decision to action.

### Alice

</div>

> Prom Queen at 15; dating my husband at 16; married at 19.

In front of the intimidating cameras of the press, Alice is cross-examined by a reporter, pointing out factual inconsistencies in Alice's words—well, Phyllis's words, really. Subsequently she is ridiculed by her team, making her lose self confidence in her abilities and utility to the cause. When Alice is later complimented that she doesn't seem to have any trouble expressing herself, she cites "liquid courage" as the reason. This interaction leading to her taking a "Christian pill" to calm her nerves and lead us to the episode's centerpiece...

Initially, we see how frightened Alice is of the conference's energy; though eventually, she's participating in the rituals to let out her own feelings through a screaming circle. Alice's munchies lead her to a mass where a woman is running the sermon, causing Alice confusion—"You're a woman. You can't consecrate the Eucharist". Led once again by her stomach, she arrives at the feast presented in the gay lounge. At this lounge, comes my favorite scene in the entire show: Alice bellows *This Land Is Your Land*, evoking great joy; yes, she's a conservative woman against the ERA, but she demonstrates how deeply human she is, irrespective of the beliefs she supports. The irony that this, her favorite song, was written by a socialist, causing her notion of those beliefs she supports into question even further. Eventually she feels remorseful for her movement's mean propaganda, as she recognizes the humanity of her opposition through this experience.

This is Alice's *Hero's Journey*. Her drug induced experience was the "special world" that challenged her and transforms her. Now, she returns to the ordinary world a new woman. The very next morning, she speaks up immediately

> "I wanted to ask why we're opposing all of the feminist resolutions. We're not anti-employment or education or minority women. I'm not saying that we shouldn't fight for what we believe in, but shouldn't we try to find consensus about something?... If we want to be taken seriously, we have to show that we are not hard-hearted; that we are not stubborn just for the sake of it. I came here to defend myself, but I have to ask: who exactly is attacking us?"

Her plea for reason is swiftly ignored, though that doesn't halt the change within Alice. We see her framed looking forward, while the anti-ERA supports are literally turned around "looking backwards, blind to what the future can be". In an affirming scene of her growth, she becomes empowered to acknowledge Pamela's home struggles, offering support to address them.

### Presence

So, what does this mean? With a contentious election coming up, am I saying to just love and appreciate the humanity in those who politically oppose you? Well, that certainly wouldn't hurt, though I think it's more accurate to take away how *difficult* it is to completely understand something as massive as the current moment. To requote Lochlin, "nothing, I think, is more interesting, more poignant, and more difficult to seize, than the intersection of the self and history." It is so difficult to let go of all the biases and anxieties that shape our perspective, pulling us away from any "objective truth" we may find. But if you consider what biases and anxieties are, they are merely the effects of focusing our attention internally to either our past or our future, neglecting the very thing we are seeking to understand: the present. Through drug use, Alice was afforded an opportunity to be fully present, allowing her to transform.

So, maybe that's my recommendation. Grab your favorite cocktail, your dankest kush, some brushes + paint, or just a meditation app. Utilize a mindfulness activity and, safely, engage in society to see what you've never noticed before, and maybe you'll return from that special word just a little bit more understanding.

Happy election year America.
