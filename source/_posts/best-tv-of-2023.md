Oops. Two years in a row my "best of" list is getting published at about the halfway mark of the following year. Oh well, better late than never! This year, I'm deciding to highlight **4** incredible tv shows out of the **25** I had seen in 2023.

### 4. Louie

> Boy, misery is wasted on the miserable. You think spending time with her, kissing her, having fun with her - you think that's what it was all about? That was love? This is love. Missing her because she's gone, wanting to die - you're so lucky. Don't you see? This is the good part. This is what you've been digging for. Now you finally have it in your hand - the sweet nugget of love, sweet sad love. And you wanna throw it away? You've got it all wrong. The bad part is when you forget her, when you don't care about her, when you don't care about anything. The bad part is coming, so enjoy the heartbreak while you can for god sake!

Out of all the shows on this list, none has directly had such a profound impact on my life philosophy as [*Louie*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1492966/). Struggling with the hardest year of my life, *Louie* taught me to not only accept heartbreak, but to **enjoy the transcendental experience** it provides. *Louie* also aptly demonstrates to be grateful for the moments of peace because we don't inherently deserve them; additionally, it asks us to not min/max happiness: although one road may lead you to be happier, it doesn't mean that you won't be happy regardless. And all these lessons are just from the 3 scenes with Dr. Bigelow's character!

Overall, *Louie* is bizarre, funny, poignant, mysterious, and evocative of emotions that I haven't found evoked from any other piece of art. Truly a show that will stick with me.



### 3. The Wire

</div>

> A life... It's the shit that happens while you're waiting for moments that never come.

[*The Wire*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0306414/) demonstrates the cyclic dependency graph of our institutions and how no one institution is safe from systemic issues, especially when there is a willingness to keep the status quo. *The Wire* can be slow at times, especially when setting up a season, but when all the pieces come together, it creates a mosaic like no other show can. When it's good and ready, this show will crush its viewers with a realistic dose of hopelessness; though, it will always highlight the goodness that can be found in your fellow man.

There is a true art to the heart of this show: no one is evil; we are all trying to navigate within the parameters set forth by society. The Herculean task of improving our society can only come as a common purpose spreading across all sectors of our society — a daunting task indeed. In spite of this hurdle, we are reminded to live our lives fully while we strive to make the world a better place, even if we never achieve it in our lifetime.



### 2. Midnight Mass

</div>

> There's this verse in the Bible. Just kind of stuck with me. 'He makes the sun rise on the evil and the good.'

I'm not sure if my mouth ever fully closed from the absolute *awe* I experienced watching this mini series in early 2023. I was thoroughly impressed by [*Midnight Mass*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10574558/) from just about every aspect, blending together to be a perfect orchestra... an angelic church choir, if you will, with hints of the devil. The vicious plot kept me on the edge of my seat, the thoughtful dialogue left me with food for thought on eternal topics like death and faith, and the *vibe* enriched this whole package to immerse me until the credits rolled.

This is one of those series that makes you want to show everyone you know.



### 1. My Brilliant Friend

<div style="max-width:750px; margin: auto;">
    <img src="my_brilliant_friend.jpg" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; width: auto\9;">
</div>

> We were twelve years old, but we walked along the hot streets of the neighborhood, amid the dust and flies that the occasional old trucks stirred up as they passed, like two old ladies taking the measure of lives of disappointment, clinging tightly to each other. No one understood us, only we two—I thought—understood one another.

[*My Brilliant Friend*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7278862/) is the best show on TV right now. No argument.

The fully fleshed out setting, the authentic performances, the character analysis over the course of a lifetime, the drastic changes in perspective that comes with age and the loss of naivety. I could go on forever. This show is complex, dripping in dramatic tension and tidbits of subtlety.

Patiently awaiting the fourth and final season to air, closing out one of the greatest sagas put to screen. In the meantime, I plan to read the first three novels this series is based on to prepare myself for the final season which will be based on the fourth and final novel.

Stop sleeping on this one.
